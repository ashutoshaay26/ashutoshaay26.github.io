> Life is a Picture, But We Live in a Pixel.

> We think a lot about those closed paths of the past, forgetting that it’s all still in our hands - new, opened life paths. 

Welcome to my playground. Here is a bit about my interests and things I do except training AI models that typical human beings love in daily life :)


## + **Outside of Work**
- Go for either a walk or run; Cardio exercise or Breathwork - Clears the mind
- Catch up on current world trends on Twitter
- Go on the drive; catch up with friends
- Conversation with Family. As Marlon Brando said in the movie Godfather: "A Man Who Doesn’t Spend Time With His Family Can Never Be a Real Man." 
- Studying and learning about long-term investing strategies; Identifying next multi baggers with atleast 10x return companies :P
- Playing cricket, badminton, tennis or computer games
- Networking with people across various domains
- Sleep - Favourite hobby :)
